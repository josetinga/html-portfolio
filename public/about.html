<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an aspiring Software Developer transitioning from the HVAC world. 
  It has been a dream of mine for the longest time, but life made me realize this by exploring various fields first. 
  I migrated to the United States when I was 18 years old from the Philippines. A few months later, I started working as an assistant IT support at a local school with the help of a family friend. 
  A good start for an IT career, right? However, being in a Filipino family, I decided to enroll in a nursing program. I managed to make it halfway before realizing it definitely was not for me.

  Naturally, as a college student with student debts and a part-time waiter job, I had nowhere to go. 
  But I did want to leave everyone I know so I can grow and find out who I am as a person. And what better way to do that than by joining the US Army? I served for 6 years as a Chemical and Nuclear Specialist. While serving, I was able to finish my Bachelor's Degree in IT with a major in Web Development. 
  At the end of my active duty enlistment in 2019, I was finally free as a bird to look for an entry-level web developer job or any IT jobs, really. 
  However, being the smart person that I am, I decided to take an extra class for HVAC certifications just because it was paid for by the Army, and ended up getting a job before I even graduated.

  Fast forward to today, I am still working as an HVAC Technician at a huge apartment complex and communities all around Waukegan, Libertyville, and Gurnee area. 
  I got so relaxed and comfortable with my job because it pays decently and it works well with my parenting schedule for my five-year-old daughter. I am a single dad, and I have her most days, so naturally, I cannot accept jobs that require heavy hours. 
  This is something that discouraged me for a long time from looking for jobs that can work with my schedule. I kept pushing it off because I knew I would go back to an entry-level position again after I had worked my way up in the HVAC field. 
  But I realized I really need and want to pursue my first love, which is computers. Coding, to be exact. So here I am, ready to start again at age 30. 
  Wiser, more patient, a better person (confirmed by my therapist), and more eager to learn than ever before.
