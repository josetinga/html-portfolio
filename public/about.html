<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an aspiring Software Developer transitioning from the HVAC world, it has been a dream of mine for the longest but 
  life sure did make me realize that by exploring various fields first. I migrated to the United States when I was 18 years old
  from the Philippines. Few months later I started working as an assistant IT support at a local school with the help of a family friend. Good start for an IT career right?
  However, of course being in a Filipino family I decided to enroll in a nursing program. I managed to make it halfway before
  I realize it is definitely not for me.

  Naturally, a college student with student debts and a part-time waiter job I had nowhere to go, but I did want to leave 
  everyone I know so I can grow and find who I am as person and what better way to do that? Definitely by joining the US Army.
  I served for 6 years as a Chemical and Nuclear Specialist. While serving I was able to finish my Bachelor's Degree in IT
  with a major in Web Development. At the end of my active duty enlistment in 2019 I was finally free as a bird to look for a job
  as an entry level web developer or any IT jobs realy. However, being the smart person that I am I decided to take an extra class for HVAC certifications
  just because it was paid for the Army aaaaand ended up getting a job before I even graduated.

  Fast forward to today I am still working as an HVAC Technician at a huge apartment complex and communities all around
  Waukegan, Libertyville and Gurnee area. I got so relaxed and comfortable with my job because it pays decent and it works very
  much with my parenting schedule with my five year old daughter. I am a single dad and I have her most days so naturally 
  I cannot accept jobs that heavy on the hours. It is something that discouraged me for a long time to be out there and look
  for jobs that can work with my schedule. I kept pushing it off and pushing it off because I know I will go back to an entry level 
  position again after I clawed my way up in the HVAC field. But, I realized I really need and want to pursue my first love which
  is computers. Coding to be exact. So here I am, ready to start again at age 30. Wiser, more patient, better person (Can comfirm
  by therapist), and more eager to learn more than ever.
